1. To determine the relationship between daily screen time and mental health indicators (stress, sleep quality, happiness).
2. To analyze how different social media platforms affect users’ mental well-being.
3. To examine how lifestyle habits (exercise and time away from social media) influence happiness and stress levels.
4. To identify demographic differences (age and gender) in social media use and their connection to mental health.
5. To visualize key findings using **Microsoft Excel** charts and pivot tables.
6. To provide actionable insights and recommendations for healthier digital habits.
